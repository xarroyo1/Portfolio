                  Welcome! 
                  My name is Xyra Arroyo. 
                  <br>
                  Born in Aneheim, California & raised in Georgia. 
                  I'm excited that I have the opportunity to be able to create my own portfolio and share it with the rest of the world. I am a first generation college graduate from Georgia State University. I obtained my Bachelors in 
                  Psychology and hope to pursue my aspiration to become a Psychologist in the near future that specializes in a varity of areas. Along the way, I quickly noticed my 
                  deep interest in web development through computer classes and java coding workshops that were offered in college. I enjoyed these classes so much
                  that I aspired a career in web development as well. I therefore applied to the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp in hopes of being able to learn everything there is about coding and apply 
                  myself in this area. 
                  <br>

      <h2> Day in the life.. </h2>
      <p>
          The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
